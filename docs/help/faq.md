# 2. Subscription & Payment

## Subscribing

### How do I subscribe (or renew my subscription)?
Itâ€™s simple! Just go **[here](https://portal.meteo-parapente.com/users/contribute/)**!

### I want to subscribe, but I donâ€™t have a phone number or donâ€™t want to share it.
We have noticed **many errors in email addresses** entered during registration or cases where emails are blocked by spam filters.

To avoid numerous messages like *"I subscribed but didnâ€™t receive my password"*, we decided to **request a phone number**. This allows us to send you an SMS with your password alongside the email.

The phone number is also useful for **recovering a lost password**.

If you donâ€™t have a mobile phone, no problem! Go
 [here](https://portal.meteo-parapente.com/users/contribute/)
and use a dummy number such as **+33 1 11 11 11 11**. However, if you entered an email address like **GMQIL.COM** and canâ€™t access the forecasts when you want to flyâ€¦ well, you were warned! ðŸ˜‰

### When filling out the subscription form, my email address appears in UPPERCASE next to the checkbox confirming its accuracy. What should I do?

Email addresses are not case-sensitive, so both uppercase and lowercase letters work the same way.

We intentionally display the email in UPPERCASE for verification purposes. This helps make typos more noticeable, as it's easy for the eye to overlook small mistakes in familiar text.

Simply ignore the uppercase formattingâ€”what matters is that the letters are in the correct order and that none are missing.

### Can I subscribe again to take advantage of a promotion if I already have an active subscription?

Yes! Your remaining subscription time will not be lost. Simply use the same email address you currently use to log in when subscribing again. Your new subscription will **extend the expiry date of your existing one**.

Please note that once you renew, you will receive a **new password** via email, which youâ€™ll need to use to log in.

### I subscribed during a promotion while my current subscription was still active, but the expiry date hasnâ€™t changed. Why?

Your new subscription has been paid for but is **not yet activated**. To activate it, please log in to our website using the new password sent to you. The site will prompt you to enter your billing details to generate the invoice. Once completed, your new subscription will be validated, and its duration will be added to the end of your current subscription.


### Whatâ€™s the difference between Contributor and Supporter?
There is **no difference in access to the data**.

Itâ€™s simply an option to contribute a little more to help **support our website**.

### I received a subscription as a gift card. How do I activate it?
Itâ€™s very simple! Just go **[ here](https://portal.meteo-parapente.com/activate)** and follow the instructions.

### I only fly during the summer holidays. Do you offer a monthly or weekly subscription?
Our subscription is **valid for a full year**, regardless of how often you use it. It works similarly to a license or insurance: even if you only use it for a few months, access and services remain available throughout the year.

We understand that some pilots fly mainly in summer, but this model allows us to **ensure a high-quality service year-round** and continue developing our tools for all subscribers.

---

## Unsubscribing

### Can you cancel my subscription?
Our subscription is **valid for a full year** and is **not automatically renewed** upon expiration unless you choose to renew it.

We understand that your needs may change, but unfortunately, **it is not possible to cancel an ongoing subscription** or split it into parts. This model allows us to maintain a stable service and continue offering quality tools to all our subscribers. Thank you for your understanding!

### I moved to another country and want to cancel my subscription.
Our subscription remains **valid for a full year** and does not renew automatically upon expiration unless you choose to renew it.

Unfortunately, our system **does not allow mid-term subscription cancellations** or partial refunds. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you continue to enjoy flying in your new country!


### I have just subscribed but want to cancel my subscription.
Please **[contact our support team](../contact.md)** immediately for a refund.

---

## Payment Issues

### I made a bank transfer but forgot to include the Mollie reference.
Unfortunately, without the unique payment reference, our payment provider, Mollie, could not associate your transfer with your account. As a result, the amount was automatically **refunded** to you.

Please make **a new transfer** and be sure to **include the reference** provided on the payment page to ensure your payment is correctly processed.

---

## Discounts

### I am a professional. Can I get a discount?
We do not differentiate between professionals and amateur pilots. The only difference is that professionals can already deduct these fees as professional expenses to reduce their taxes. There are **no discounts for either professionals or amateur pilots**.

### Can you offer a discount for our club?
Sorry, but **we can not offer specific pricing** for clubs. As a small company with costly infrastructure (our calculations require significant computing power, and electricity costs keep rising!), we rely on our subscribers to sustain our service.

If pilots were to use shared club subscriptions or share their access, it would jeopardize our existence. Thank you for your understanding!

# 3. Understanding Weather Predictions

## Colors & Interpretation

### What do the colors at the bottom of thermals represent?
This is a **new feature** that indicates the **strength of upward thermal currents**.

- The **redder** the color, the **stronger the thermals**.

### What do the colors in the wind/altitude graph mean?
- **Shades of yellow** represent **atmospheric instability**: the darker the yellow, the more unstable the air.
- **Gray** indicates the **presence of clouds** at different altitudes, with varying intensity depending on their thickness.

---

## Shear & Other Weather Indicators

### What does shear mean?
Shear is a **subjective indicator** that evaluates the **ratio between thermal speed and wind speed**. It helps estimate whether the lift will be **smooth and pleasant** or **turbulent and choppy**.

A **green color (higher value)** indicates the presence of thermals with **little wind**, resulting in more **stable and comfortable** lift conditions.

---


## Help & Documentation

### Where can I find a help file?
We are currently working on a **comprehensive guide** that will explain everything in detail. Itâ€™s a work in progress.

In the meantime, you can find useful resources onlineâ€”many experienced pilots have already published videos explaining how to use the tool. A quick **internet search** should help! ðŸ˜Š

# 4. Troubleshooting & Issues

## Forecast & Data Issues

### I am a subscriber, but I can only see the forecast for one day.
It is likely that you are not logged in as a subscriber.

To check, click on the **settings icon** at the top right of the page to open the menu. Look at the bottom of the menu: **is your email displayed there?**

- **If not**, click on **"Login"** (third line from the bottom) and enter your email and password.
- **If yes**, try refreshing the page.

If the problem persists after this, please **[contact us](../contact.md)** to report it. It may be a temporary issue with the site, and we will do our best to resolve it as quickly as possible!

### Why can I only see the forecast for two days?
Forecasts are published in the **mid-morning**, but the exact time may vary depending on the weather conditions of the day. More difficult conditions mean a **longer calculation time**.

If you only see two days of forecasts, it is likely because the latest calculation is taking longer than usual. This can happen when the volume of data is larger, for example, if there is **strong wind**. In that case, the **third day is still being processed** and should appear very soon.

If this happens, try **checking back in an hour**.

### Can I access past data from a few days (or weeks) ago?
Unfortunately, this is not possible. **Weather data is extremely large**, and storing it long-term would require a **huge amount of resources**. Thatâ€™s why only forecasts and the current dayâ€™s data are available.

At this time, we do not have the ability to provide past data. **Sorry for the limitation!**

### Can you add forecasts for La RÃ©union?
Unfortunately, this is **not planned for the near future**. Weather calculations become too complex and expensive when dealing with **isolated areas**, unlike our current coverage, which is **continuous** (e.g., Europe).

However, this remains a **long-term project** that we have already considered.

---

## Aerospace Data

### I found an error in the airspace data.
If you noticed an error in the airspace data, please report it directly to **[OpenAIP](https://www.openaip.net/)**.

Once the correction is made on their platform, it will automatically be updated on our site within a few days. **Thank you for your vigilance!**

---

## Flying Spots

### Can you add or remove a takeoff/landing site?
The takeoff and landing sites in **MÃ©tÃ©o-Parapente** come from the **Paragliding Earth** database.

If you would like to add a new site, you simply need to **register it on Paragliding Earth**. It will automatically be integrated **in the next major update** of MÃ©tÃ©o-Parapente.

### The altitude of my takeoff site does not match its real altitude on your site.
This is **completely normal**. Weather models work by **interpolation** and use a grid with **pixels** a few kilometers wide. The altitude displayed is a **calculated average** over that area, which may result in a discrepancy between the displayed and actual altitudeâ€”except in **flat terrain**.

This is how all weather models work, whether itâ€™s ours, **MÃ©tÃ©o-France**, or others. This approximation is necessary to ensure **consistent forecasts on a large scale**. ðŸ˜Š

---

## Favorites & Customization

### Can I access my favorites on all my devices?
This feature will be available in **future versions** of the website and app.

For now, **favorites are only stored locally** on your device. This means that if you switch devices or browsers, your saved favorites will not be available. We recognize this as a limitation and are working to improve it soon! ðŸ˜Š

### My favorite spots have disappeared. Why?
Your favorites may disappear in the following cases:

- **Clearing browser data** â€“ If you delete your browserâ€™s cookies or **HTML5 Local Storage**, your saved favorites will be lost.
- **Limited storage space** â€“ If your device is running low on storage, the system might automatically free up space by deleting non-essential data, including your favorites.
- **Privacy or antivirus software** â€“ Some **antivirus programs** or **privacy tools** may remove stored data as part of their system cleanup.

If possible, check your browser or system settings to prevent automatic deletion in the future. ðŸ˜Š

## Application Issues

### After a software update, my app no longer works.
If you are experiencing issues after updating the app, we recommend **uninstalling and reinstalling** it from your store (**App Store or Google Play**). This often resolves any conflicts caused by the update.

If the problem persists, please **[contact us](../contact.md)** and provide:

- Your **device model**
- Your **operating system version**
- A **screenshot** of the issue (if possible)

We will do our best to help you quickly! ðŸ˜Š

### My app no longer works on my new iPhone.
We are really sorry for this inconvenience. Unfortunately, a compatibility issue with the latest **iOS version** is preventing our app from working correctly.

To restore compatibility, we need to make significant changes to the appâ€™s code, which was not initially planned in our schedule. This will take some time, and we understand how frustrating this may be.

The good news is that you can still access **100% of the features** without using the app! Simply open your mobile browser and visit **[www.meteo-parapente.com](https://www.meteo-parapente.com)**.

Again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience and understanding! ðŸ˜Š

### I donâ€™t see the background map in my app.
It appears that your **Android version is outdated** and is part of the **2% of older versions still in use**. Due to **Googleâ€™s requirements**, we had to update the technology used in the app to ensure compatibility with newer Android versions. Unfortunately, this update is **not compatible with older versions**, like yours.

At this time, we havenâ€™t found a solution that would allow the new app to function properly on these older versions. We understand that this may be frustrating, and we sincerely apologize.

While we work on resolving this issue, we recommend using the **mobile version of our website** instead. It offers the **same features** as the app and will allow you to continue enjoying our services without any limitations.

## Other Technical Issues

### One or a few arrows are missing on the bottom of the screen in my app.

![Arrow missing](/img/mto-para-help-arrows-missing.jpg)

This issue is likely related to the **font size** or **accessibility settings** on your Android device. In short, the device is "zooming in" too much, leaving no space for all the arrows to fit on the screen. Reducing the font size should resolve the problem.

Here are the recommended settings to prevent this issue:

![Android font](/img/mto-para-help-font-android.png)

### I am from Australia and I cannot connect to your website or application.

Some Australian users have recently experienced connection issues with our website and application. This appears to be related to certain Australian internet providers.

While we continue investigating the issue, you can access our website using any VPN service with an IP address outside of Australia. If using a VPN is not an option for you, please **[contact us](../contact.md)** for a reimbursement.

### I found a bug on your site.
A big **thank you** for taking the time to report bugs! Your feedback is valuable and helps us **continuously improve** the service.

To help us analyze and fix the issue as quickly as possible, please **[contact us](../contact.md)** and provide:

  - A **screenshot**
  - A **brief description** of the bug (what you were doing when the issue occurred, any error messages, etc.)

We will do our best to resolve it quickly. **Thanks again for your help!** ðŸ˜Š
